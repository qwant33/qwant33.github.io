What is this magic  in the tomorrow that never seems to come
That tomorrow will transmute my self-destruction into generation



......




What is this dancing smoke of incense?
This dance of space, beyond Nyx?
It has a life of its own
In the womb of Aima
A Star is born
Paramita
And
A
New
Man

What is this charge of kundalini?
This entangled battle of snakes
Of purple eyes and gnosis
A tree consumed by fire
Fanciful as Faust
Tantalizing
To
Taste

What is this Living Flame of Love?
This Enveloping Luxury of Presence
A feast of Higher Fruits
No more phantasmagoria
No more simulacra
But a lip kiss
From Theresa
